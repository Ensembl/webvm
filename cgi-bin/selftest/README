These are both

  CGI scripts (mapping to /cgi-bin/selftest/* on each Apache)
  which are sourced by http:/cgi-bin/taps

  and standard prove scripts
    e.g. prove -I $WEBDIR/lib/bootstrap -rv cgi-bin/selftest

They should all pass in either mode, though the environments may be
different and the HTtapTP access method is more likely to be
frequently tested.
