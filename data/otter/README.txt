This Git repository defines the contents of
  /nfs/WWWdev/SANGER_docs/data/otter

as a series of renaming-merges of branches for the 'root' files
(users.txt etc.) and the major version files.

Edits made directly to the checked out files in /nfs/WWWdev are likely
to be lost.



The history for this data was gathered by team_tools.git
/saveconf/update.sh and munged into separate branches by
/saveconf/otter_data/vsn_split.sh

After this switchover point it is maintained by Git actions and
team_tools.git /bin/server-config-op
